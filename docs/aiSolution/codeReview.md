Are the variable and method names meaningful and descriptive? Give specific examples to support your observation. How could the variable and method names be improved?

I do believe the variable and method names are meaningful and descriptive. They are relevant to the project. For example methods like MancalaGame, DisplayResults, and determineWinner are all meaninfgul and describe what its about. They could be improved by being a bit more specific. For example makeMove and displayBoard could be more clear and concise

Does the code follow coding conventions and formatting standards? Has it made appropriate use of includes? Are static members used properly? Give specific examples of how you would improve the coding conventions used.

It does follow coding convetions and formatting standards. It includes import statements, and has a main method. 

Are the classes properly encapsulated? Are member variables private? Are accessor and mutator methods used? How could you improve the encapsulation of this code?

It does follow encapsulation, member variables are private, and accessor methods are used. I dont think i would improve it as I feel as thought it demonstrates it well. 

Is there any duplication of code in this project? Are there methods that do essentially the same thing, or parts of the same thing that could be made into smaller methods?

There isnt any duplication. I would say the methods displayResults and displayBoard could be combined 

Does each class and method have a single, obvious purpose or responsibility? Are there any long methods that should be broken up into smaller methods? Give specific examples of how you could improve the code with respect to responsibilities.

Yes it does. MancalaGame handles all the gamic logic, and classes suich as Player and board represent the board and the playersI feel like the mancalaGame could give more resoponsabilities to the board class
